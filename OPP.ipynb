        "Ans1- The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class or object. This helps to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world and provides a way to access and modify the data only through controlled interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of representing complex systems in a simplified way by exposing only the necessary information to the outside world. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and improve modularity by hiding the implementation details of an object and showing only its essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class based on an existing class. The new class, called the subclass or derived class, inherits the properties and behavior of the existing class, called the superclass or base class. Inheritance helps to promote code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is the concept of taking on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, method overriding, or operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Composition\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition is the concept of combining objects or data types to form a new object or data type. Composition helps to create complex objects from simpler ones and facilitates the creation of objects that have a hierarchical or aggregate structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "These five key concepts of OOP provide the foundation for designing and developing robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.\n",

        "car.display_info()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an explanation of how the code works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We define a Car class with an __init__ method that initializes the object's attributes: make, model, and year.\n",
        "2. We define a display_info method that prints out the car's information.\n",
        "3. In the example usage, we create a new Car object with make=\"Toyota\", model=\"Corolla\", and year=2015.\n",
        "4. We call the display_info method on the car object to print out its information.\n",

        "Q3- Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each ?\n",
        "Ans3- In Python, instance methods and class methods are two types of methods that can be defined in a class. The main difference between them is the way they are called and the data they have access to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance methods are methods that belong to an instance of a class. They are called on an instance of the class and have access to the instance's attributes. Instance methods are used to perform actions that are specific to an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

        "my_car = Car(\"red\")\n",
        "my_car.honk()  # Output: The red car honks!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the honk method is an instance method because it is called on an instance of the Car class (my_car). The method has access to the instance's color attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods are methods that belong to a class itself, rather than an instance of the class. They are called on the class and have access to the class's attributes. Class methods are used to perform actions that are related to the class as a whole, rather than a specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    num_cars = 0\n",

        "In this example, the get_num_cars method is a class method because it is called on the Car class itself, rather than an instance of the class. The method has access to the class's num_cars attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note the use of the @classmethod decorator to indicate that the get_num_cars method is a class method. The cls parameter is used to refer to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.\n",
        "Q4- How does python implement method overloading? Give an example?\n",
        "Ans4- Python does not directly support method overloading like some other programming languages, such as Java or C++. However, Python provides several ways to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to implement method overloading in Python is by using default argument values. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def calculate(self, a, b=None):\n",
        "        if b is None:\n",
        "            return a ** 2\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "calculator = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(5))  # Output: 25\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the calculate method takes two arguments, a and b. However, b has a default value of None. This allows the method to be called with either one or two arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way to implement method overloading in Python is by using the *args syntax to accept a variable number of arguments. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def calculate(self, *args):\n",
        "        if len(args) == 1:\n",
        "            return args[0] ** 2\n",
        "        elif len(args) == 2:\n",
        "            return args[0] + args[1]\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Invalid number of arguments\")\n",
        "\n",
        "calculator = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(5))  # Output: 25\n",
        "print(calculator.calculate(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the calculate method takes a variable number of arguments using the *args syntax. The method then checks the length of the args tuple to determine which calculation to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you can use the singledispatch decorator from the functools module to implement method overloading. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "from functools import singledispatch\n",
        "\n",
        "@singledispatch\n",
        "def calculate(arg):\n",
        "    raise TypeError(\"Unsupported type\")\n",
        "\n",
        "@calculate.register\n",
        "def _(arg: int):\n",
        "    return arg ** 2\n",
        "\n",
        "@calculate.register\n",
        "def _(arg: tuple):\n",
        "    return arg[0] + arg[1]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(calculate(5))  # Output: 25\n",
        "print(calculate((5, 3)))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the calculate function is decorated with the @singledispatch decorator. This decorator allows you to register multiple functions with the same name but different type signatures. The @calculate.register decorator is used to register each function. The function that is called depends on the type of the argument passed to the calculate function.\n",
        "Q5- What are the three modifiers in python? How are they denoted ?\n",
        "Ans5- [3:19 PM, 12/3/2024] Meta AI: In Python, there are three access modifiers that can be used to control access to a class's attributes and methods. These modifiers are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Public: Public attributes and methods can be accessed from anywhere in the program. They are denoted by no underscore prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: class MyClass: def my_method(self): pass\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Protected: Protected attributes and methods can be accessed within the class itself and by subclasses. They are denoted by a single underscore prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: class MyClass: def _my_method(self): pass\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Private: Private attributes and methods can only be accessed within the class itself. They are denoted by a double underscore prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: class MyClass: def __my_method(self): pass\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that Python does not have strict enforcement of access modifiers like some other languages. Instead, it relies on a convention of using underscores to indicate the intended level of access. The actual access control is implemented through a mechanism called \"name mangling,\" which changes the name of the attribute or method to make it more difficult to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you define a private attribute __my_attribute in a class MyClass, Python will internally change the name of the attribute to _MyClass__my_attribute. This makes it more difficult to access the attribute from outside the class, but it does not provide strict enforcement of access control.\n",

        "Ans6-[9:45 PM, 12/5/2024] Meta AI: In Python, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes in a class's inheritance hierarchy. It is used to resolve the order of method calls when there are multiple classes in the inheritance chain.\n",
